20230927:
- Project created
- Created initial main function and pseudocode
- Created writeup file
- Created header and implementation file for algorithms
	- I have a preference for this type of setup, because it helps me stay organized.
- Copied pseudocode from notes into implementation file.

20230928:
- Converted implementation pseudocode to real code
	- Left in-place as comments, where necessary
- Converted main function speudocode into real code
	- Wrote initial code for simple integer arrays
	- Used console outputs to ensure basic version of program functioned and display run counts
- ISSUE: I seem to be unable to get a for loop working for the actual merge in the Merge method.
	- Found a solution online which suggests while-loops. Using those for now, will fix later if I have time. (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-sort/)
- Refactored Code for readability.
- Created "pokemon" struct to prepare for formatting of data being read from csv files
	- Converted arrays of integers into arrays of structs
- Wrote code to read data from file, using a hard-coded file name
	- Struggling with how to import the data, given that I need to assign it as different datatypes.
	- Found a function include in <string> which can conver strings to integers.
		- Problem resolved after implementing.
- Converted to accept filename as a user argument at runtime.

- Stretch Goal: Outputing data to individual, new csv files.

Writeup instructions:
	To Include...
	- Instructions for compiling code
	- Explanation of implementations
	- Discussion of whether or not the data seems normal
	- Runtime estimations and graph
